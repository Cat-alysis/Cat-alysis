I am @Cat-alysis, the one and only (as far as I know).
I enjoy art, and making art (I don't think I get as far as *making it* but I do want to).
I am currently developing LSD FC++ CGWE (Lys' Survival Dark Forest C++ Console Game Windows Exclusive, not exclusive in purpose I just wouldn't know how to port it and this is my first serious project).
I'll set up an email and you can send me feedback and glitches (although I really can't see how any would appear in a game with a logic so simple).
My pronouns are she/her, and I am a trans girl. If you do not like that, begone phobe.
I hope my game (and maybe eventually games) is enjoyable, although I doubt it.
